# HEXAPOD-ROBOT
Designing and developing a six-legged hexapod robot with 18Â° of freedom, each leg driven by 3 servo motors for precise multi-axis motion. Arduino-based control enables gait generation, balance, and terrain adaptability. Focused on inverse kinematics, wireless control, and autonomous exploration.
